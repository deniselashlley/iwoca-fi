    2. Using `nvm`: Run `nvm install` to install the node version and `nvm use` to use it
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` to start the frontend and the api server

### The Task

_If completing as a take home task_

1. Please take a look at [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Y8kFd9tM/iwoca-application-portal-test), which has a selection of bugs / features to be completed
1. Chose whatever tickets you would like to do from the the Trello board that you think will take around 2 hours of work.
1. Any comments you want to pass along to the reviewer add to COMMENTS.md and commit
1. To submit either send us a link to your public fork or another public repo. Alternatively you can zip up your files minus `node_modules` and email it over.

_If completing as an in person interview._

1. You will be completing 1 or 2 tickets from [the Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Y8kFd9tM/iwoca-application-portal-test) as a pair programming exercise so take a read before you come in.
2. Please set up and familiarise yourself with the repo, feel free to attempt any of smaller bugs to get a feel for the codebase (not compulsory)

### Notes

-   Feel free to alter the technologies used in the code base, eg. we use CSS modules but if you are more comfortable with `styled-components` for example you can install and use that for your portion of the task.
-   We love integration tests, any well thought out ones will be very well received by the reviewer
-   Attention to detail in the design will go a long way.
-   All the tickets features are for desktop but we would be very happy to see mobile considered.
-   Remember to check your project runs before submitting. - we will be running it in development mode to review.
-   Feel free to refactor the code where appropriate.
